# asset-party-bot
A small python bot that would auto-enter raffles to win a key from asset-party. Lets you sign into steam if with steams generated QR code.

The concept behind it still works, but unfortunately the site no longer does raffles anymore, they go by a referral system.
It was made in a quick amount of time, therefore no prior planning was made for this script and was just winged the whole way through.
